## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a busy professional in Vancouver who appreciates Asian cuisine, I want to subscribe to a weekly meal delivery service that provides healthy, authentic Asian fusion meals, so I can enjoy convenient, nutritious dining without the hassle of cooking or compromising on taste and cultural authenticity.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### New Customer Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor on the website, **When** they enter their postal code, **Then** they see if delivery is available in their area
2. **Given** a visitor viewing the menu, **When** they select meals for a bundle, **Then** they can choose between one-time purchase or subscription
3. **Given** a customer at checkout, **When** they choose subscription, **Then** they receive a 5% discount on their order
4. **Given** a customer completing checkout, **When** payment is successful, **Then** they receive an order confirmation email

#### Subscriber Scenarios

1. **Given** an active subscriber, **When** Thursday 5:00 PM arrives, **Then** they receive an email about the new weekly menu
2. **Given** a subscriber viewing next week's menu, **When** they update their meal selection before Tuesday 6:00 PM (for Sunday delivery) or Saturday 6:00 PM (for Wednesday delivery), **Then** their choices are saved for delivery
3. **Given** a subscriber wanting to skip a week, **When** they select skip before Tuesday 6:00 PM (for Sunday delivery) or Saturday 6:00 PM (for Wednesday delivery), **Then** they are not charged or delivered that week
4. **Given** a subscriber with 5+ meals ordered, **When** delivery arrives, **Then** meals come in insulated bags

#### Admin Scenarios

1. **Given** an admin on Thursday morning, **When** they schedule the weekly menu, **Then** it automatically publishes at 5:00 PM
2. **Given** an admin after Wednesday cutoff, **When** they generate packing lists, **Then** they see all orders grouped by delivery day
3. **Given** an admin reviewing analytics, **When** they access reports, **Then** they see sales, popular meals, and retention metrics

### Edge Cases

- **Outside delivery zone**: Input validation prevents users from proceeding to checkout if address is outside delivery zone
- **Payment failures for subscriptions**: System retries 3 times with 3-hour intervals, then cancels order and sends payment retry link
- **No meal selection before cutoff**: First-time subscribers must select meals to complete subscription; existing subscribers who miss the deadline receive system default recommendations of 3 meals
- **Delivery/quality complaints**: Customers use provided info email address to contact customer service
- **Inventory stock-outs**: 200 meal daily limit prevents stock-outs; customer service contacts customers via email/WeChat/phone if issues arise
