# Technical Research: FitBox Meal App

**Date**: 2025-09-11  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Validation

## Technology Stack Research

### Frontend Framework Decision

**Decision**: Next.js 14+ with App Router  
**Rationale**:

- Server-side rendering for SEO (crucial for food delivery marketing)
- Built-in API routes eliminate separate backend framework
- App Router provides modern React patterns with RSC
- Excellent TypeScript integration and developer experience
- Vercel ecosystem integration (hosting, analytics, edge functions)

**Alternatives considered**:

- Remix: Less mature ecosystem, smaller community
- Pure React + Express: Additional complexity managing separate projects
- Vue.js/Nuxt: Team familiarity with React ecosystem preferred

### UI Component Library Decision

**Decision**: shadcn/ui with MCP integration  
**Rationale**:

- Copy-paste approach gives full control over components
- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- MCP integration enables intelligent component discovery and updates
- Tailwind CSS integration for consistent design system
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns built-in

**Alternatives considered**:

- Material-UI: Too opinionated, harder to customize for brand
- Ant Design: Desktop-first approach, not optimal for mobile
- Chakra UI: Good but less momentum than shadcn/ui ecosystem

### State Management Decision

**Decision**: Zustand + TanStack Query  
**Rationale**:

- Zustand: Simple, lightweight, TypeScript-first state management
- TanStack Query: Best-in-class server state management with caching
- Avoids Redux complexity for this scale of application
- Excellent DevTools and debugging experience

**Alternatives considered**:

- Redux Toolkit: Overkill for initial MVP, can migrate later if needed
- Jotai: Atomic approach interesting but team familiarity with Zustand
- React Context: Not suitable for complex state management at this scale

### Database & ORM Decision

**Decision**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM  
**Rationale**:

- PostgreSQL: Mature, ACID compliant, excellent for e-commerce data
- Prisma: Type-safe database access, excellent TypeScript integration
- Built-in migration system and schema management
- Great developer experience with Prisma Studio
- Supports multiple database providers for future flexibility

**Alternatives considered**:

- MySQL: PostgreSQL has better JSON support and advanced features
- Supabase: Good option but Prisma provides more ORM control
- MongoDB: Relational data model better suited to e-commerce

### Authentication Decision

**Decision**: NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)  
**Rationale**:

- Native Next.js integration with App Router
- Built-in security best practices (CSRF, secure cookies)
- Multiple provider support for future expansion
- Active development and community support
- Handles session management and JWT tokens

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom JWT implementation: Security risks, maintenance overhead
- Firebase Auth: Vendor lock-in, less control over user data
- Supabase Auth: Good option but NextAuth more flexible

### Payment Processing Decision

**Decision**: Stripe with Stripe Subscriptions  
**Rationale**:

- Industry standard for subscription billing
- Excellent documentation and TypeScript support
- Built-in PCI compliance handling
- Robust webhook system for payment events
- Strong Canadian market presence and CAD support

**Alternatives considered**:

- PayPal: Less feature-rich subscription management
- Square: Primarily POS-focused, limited subscription features
- Custom payment handling: PCI compliance complexity

## Architecture Patterns Research

### Component Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Atomic Design with Server/Client Component split  
**Rationale**:

- Atomic Design (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages)
- Clear separation between Server Components (SEO, static) and Client Components (interactive)
- Promotes reusability and consistent design system
- Maps well to shadcn/ui component structure

### API Design Decision

**Decision**: RESTful API with Next.js Route Handlers  
**Rationale**:

- REST is well-understood and suitable for CRUD operations
- Next.js App Router provides excellent TypeScript API routes
- Easier to cache and optimize than GraphQL for this use case
- Client-side API integration simpler with REST

**Alternatives considered**:

- GraphQL: Overkill for MVP, adds complexity
- tRPC: Interesting but REST more universally understood by team

### File Structure Decision

**Decision**: Feature-based organization with shared components

```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/          # Shared components
│   ├── ui/             # shadcn/ui base components
│   └── custom/         # App-specific components
├── features/           # Feature-specific components and logic
├── lib/               # Shared utilities and configurations
├── stores/            # Zustand stores
└── types/             # TypeScript definitions
```

## Development Environment Research

### Development Tooling Decision

**Decision**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky + TypeScript strict mode  
**Rationale**:

- Industry standard code quality tools
- Pre-commit hooks ensure consistent code style
- TypeScript strict mode catches errors early
- Automated formatting reduces code review friction

### Testing Strategy Decision

**Decision**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright + Supertest  
**Rationale**:

- Jest: Fast unit testing with great React integration
- RTL: Testing user behavior rather than implementation details
- Playwright: Cross-browser E2E testing with excellent debugging
- Supertest: API testing with Express/Next.js integration

### CI/CD Decision

**Decision**: GitHub Actions + Vercel deployment  
**Rationale**:

- Native GitHub integration
- Vercel provides excellent Next.js deployment experience
- Preview deployments for every PR
- Built-in performance monitoring and analytics

## Mobile-First Design Research

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS breakpoint system with mobile-first approach  
**Rationale**:

- Mobile-first CSS ensures optimal mobile performance
- Tailwind breakpoints: sm(640px), md(768px), lg(1024px), xl(1280px)
- Touch-friendly UI with 44px minimum touch targets
- Progressive enhancement from mobile to desktop

### PWA Features Research

**Decision**: Phase 2 implementation of Service Worker and Web App Manifest  
**Rationale**:

- Focus on core functionality first
- PWA features add value for returning customers
- Offline capability useful for menu browsing
- Push notifications for delivery updates

## Performance Optimization Research

### Core Web Vitals Strategy

**Decision**: Image optimization + Code splitting + Caching strategy  
**Rationale**:

- Next.js Image component with Cloudinary for optimized delivery
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Static generation for marketing pages
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for menus

**Target Metrics**:

- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- FID (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

## Security Research

### Security Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Input validation + SQL injection prevention + XSS protection + CSRF protection  
**Rationale**:

- Zod schemas for all user inputs and API validation
- Prisma ORM prevents SQL injection through parameterized queries
- Content Security Policy headers prevent XSS attacks
- NextAuth.js provides built-in CSRF protection

### Data Protection Strategy

**Decision**: Encryption at rest + HTTPS only + Secure cookie settings  
**Rationale**:

- Database encryption for sensitive payment data
- Force HTTPS in production with HSTS headers
- Secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
