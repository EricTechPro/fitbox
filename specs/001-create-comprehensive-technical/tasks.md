# Tasks: FitBox Meal App MVP - Sequential Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-comprehensive-technical/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-spec.yaml, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Found: Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Stripe, shadcn/ui
   → ✅ Structure: Web app (frontend + backend in Next.js)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: Simplified to 6 core entities for MVP Phase 1
   → ✅ contracts/: Focus on essential API endpoints (20+ for MVP)
   → ✅ research.md: Technology decisions validated
   → ✅ quickstart.md: 9 core user journeys for validation
3. Generate tasks by priority phases:
   → MVP Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Essential ordering system (20 tasks)
   → Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Subscription system (15 tasks)
   → Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Growth features (20 tasks)
4. Apply task rules:
   → Sequential execution for faster delivery
   → Tests before implementation (TDD enforced)
   → Focus on core value delivery first
5. Number tasks by priority (T001-T055)
6. Focus on MVP Phase 1: Core ordering for immediate launch
7. SUCCESS: 55 tasks reorganized for sequential delivery
```
